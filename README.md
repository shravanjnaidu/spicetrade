# spicetrade

Simple demo app to publish and browse ads.

Getting started (Windows PowerShell):

1. Install dependencies
   npm install

2. Start the server
   npm start

3. Open in your browser
   http://localhost:3000

Notes:

- This is a minimal, demo implementation. Passwords are hashed with bcryptjs but there is no production-ready authentication/session management.
- Database is stored in data/db.sqlite.
